    "It was expected that there was a correlation between age and the serum cholesterol, taken into consideration that correlation does not imply causation. Plotting the relationship between them, it is observed that there is indeed something interesting about the graph. There are many data points that have clustered together. Their center could be averaged in between 50 and 60 years old intersecting the serum cholesterol level at around 230 mg, which is considered borderline high by the FDA. \\url{https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/K063852.pdf}\n",

    "\\includegraphics[scale=0.62]{ageHeart.png}\n",
    "\n",
    "We correlated the maximum heart rate achieved by the individual to their age. Since older people have to decrease their physical activity at some point, some of their organs could possibly fail to support fully them if the tried to push their limits. The graph pretty much aligns with our initial guess as the maximum heart corresponds to younger peoples. There are a couple of points that maintained the same maximum heart rate while getting older; yet, these could be considered as outliers due to some other parameters that this plot had not reveled.  \n",
    "\\item Age and resting blood pressure\\\\\n",
    "\\includegraphics[scale=0.62]{ageBlood.png}\\\\\n",
    "Since it is known that age and resting blood pressure are correlated to how healthy human beings are, we were really interested to reveal if there was any covariance between these 2 parameters. Again, a scatter plot shows how people in between 50 and 60 years old could be having some physical abnormality. Many clusters are found closer to resting blood pressure of 140, which is where there would be critical risks, according to the FDA. \\url{https://www.fda.gov/media/85157/download}\n",
    "\\item Age and number of major vessels\\\\\n",
    "\\includegraphics[scale=0.62]{ageVessels.png}\\\\\n",
    "\n",
    "We were not sure about this correlation as this is could prove either a strong correlation or a weak between heart diseases and age. However, we found out that the data points are scattered in a random way, so this graph could either tell that there is absolutely no correlation or due to some other external factors, no correlation could be caught.   \n",

    "\\item Resting blood pressure and serum cholesterol \\\\\n",
    "\\includegraphics[scale=0.62]{bloodSerum.png}\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing that cholesterol is basically a fatty substance and that older people have slower rate of burning  calories than the younger ones. We initially guessed that there could be a correlation that plotting this graph could possibly reveal. This scatter plot did not have solid observations as no noticeable clusters are found at a specific range of number of vessels. There are a couple of reasons why this happened; it could be due to how small the dataset is. The smaller the dataset, the higher impact some outliers can affect the sample. Also, there could be some external parameters that are not considered with respect to either of the number of vessels or the age; yet, they could be affecting the other parameters in an indirect way. Moreover, the graph could be proving that our intuition is not true.    \\\\\n",
