## Overview

Welcome to our Data Science project repository for CSCI-347 Data Mining. This project focuses on applying various data science techniques and algorithms to medical diagnostic work, with a specific emphasis on heart disease prediction. Our work is inspired by the potential of machine learning to revolutionize medical diagnostics, making early detection and prevention of diseases like heart disease more accurate and accessible.

## Dataset

We utilize the **Statlog Heart Disease Dataset** from the UCI machine learning repository. This dataset is widely recognized in the data science field for its applications in diverse research studies. It contains 270 instances with 13 attributes and no missing values, making it an ideal candidate for our analysis.

### Attributes

The dataset features the following attributes, crucial for heart disease diagnosis:

- Age
- Sex (binary: male or female)
- Chest Pain Type (4 values, label-encoded)
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Serum Cholesterol in mg/dl
- Fasting Blood Sugar > 120 mg/dl (binary)
- Resting Electrocardiographic Results (0,1,2)
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Exercise Induced Angina (binary)
- Oldpeak (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest)
- The Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment
- Number of Major Vessels (0-3) Colored by Flourosopy
- Thal (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)

## Project Structure

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks covering the following key topics:

- **Graph Analysis**: Exploration of data relationships and patterns.
- **Linear Transformation**: Application of linear algebra techniques to optimize data representation.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Unsupervised learning method to identify data clusters.
- Additional notebooks will explore various data preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning techniques relevant to our project's goal.

## Objectives

Our project aims to:

1. **Evaluate and Clean the Dataset**: Assess the quality, potential biases, and applicability of the dataset for heart disease diagnostics.
2. **Apply Data Mining Techniques**: Utilize various algorithms to uncover patterns and insights that could inform medical diagnostics.
3. **Enhance Medical Diagnostic Work**: Explore how machine learning can improve diagnostic accuracy, focusing on heart disease.
